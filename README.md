# Arkanoid_Urho3D
Arkanoid-like technical demo (work in progress). You will not find fine tuned gameplay or graphics here, at least not in the near future. It's not fully featured game but rather attempt at using Urho3D for Android. However it's totally possible to add it all to project.

## Credits:
Arkanoid_Urho3D development, graphics and bugfixes by Victor Antoci.

## Compilation:
You can use one of the cmake_*.sh (there are more of them in Urho3D itself) to compile program for Linux. To compile it for Android use cmake_android.sh (under Linux environment). Although I didn't try it yet, Windows version should also compile fine, but I didn't optimize input neigher for Windows nor for Linux. Urho3D projects compilation is very similar to compilation of Urho3D itself, so you can find more here: https://github.com/urho3d/Urho3D/wiki/Setting-up-a-Project-(CMake) and here: https://urho3d.github.io/documentation/1.7/_building.html

## Gameplay
First touch moves paddle, second touch (at the same time) starts ball.
